This project aims at providing functional Text To Speech software for Linux. It will allow the user to have text such as text in a PDF, on the web, word processors, and ANY text that can be copied to the clipboard to automatically be read without user intervention using one or more of the OSS (Open Source Software, Not Open Sound System) text speech synthesizers made for Linux. Features to be included are
  * Ability to test and choose from many voices
  * The ability to set the speed and gap between words spoken
  * Pitch and pause of a voice being spoken
  * Replay or read the text again
  * Pause and resume feature
  * A mini gui that can be kept on top of other windows without clobbering all other windows
  * A rewind feature that will go back n number of sentences and start reading again.
  * And more features to come!
